Introduction

What is Shango?

Shango is a line input command interpeter that can not only be used as a 
replacement for the default command interpeter utility of an operating system
(such as cmd.exe on the Windows NT platforms), but also creates new ways for humans
to interact with computers.  It does this chiefly by blurring the line between 
the Grahpical User Interface (GUI) that brought computers to the masses and
the command line interface that continues to survive among advanced users.


Key Features

1.  VBScript is the shell language
2.  Supports the concept of layered "meta-shells"
3.  Includes advanced utilities that allow browsing of the ole automation classes
    for a machine, as well as the .Net classes for the machine
4.  The command processor is extensible -- user enhancements can allow pre and post
    processing of commands
5.  Integrates with speech recognition and text to speech capabilities
6.  Extensible mechanism to display complex data files such as html and bitmaps
    inside the shell itself
7.  Extensible text editor built into the shell itself
8.  Task-switching inside the shell to reduce the need to start multiple shells
9.  Compatibility with ANSI terminal type for color rendering
10. Ability to save shell contents in rich text or html format
11. Ability to "name" to avoid starting new shell instances
12. Native remoting -- shells can be started remotely, and existing shells can 
    be shared among multiple clients
13. Advanced formatting options such as alpha-blended backgrounds, bitmap backgrounds,
    mixed fonts, multiple colors
